# ioT-based Smart Energy Meter

IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter with Energy Forecasting

This repository contains the work for a University Module Team Project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
The main objective of this project was to design and simulate a system that can monitor real-time energy consumption, calculate electricity usage, and introduce smart billing while also predicting future consumption patterns using machine learning. 

This project aimed to demonstrate how energy wastage can be reduced, bills optimized, and usage trends analyzed for better decision-making.

# A. Simulation

## 🛠 Tools
- **Proteus 8 Professional** – Circuit design & simulation.  
- **Arduino IDE** – Code development & .hex file generation.  
- **MySQL + PhpMyAdmin** – Simulated cloud platforms.  

## Components Used
- **Arduino UNO**
- **ACS712 Current Sensor**.  
- **Voltage Divider Circuit** (alternative to unavailable ZMPT101B).  
- **ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller / Arduino Ethernet Shield**.  
- **LCD Display** (for real-time values).
- 
## Energy Calculation
- P (Watts) = V x I
- E (Jouls) = P x t 
- E (Watts per hour) = (P x t) / 3600
- θ = 50Hz x 360 x ∆t
- Power Factor = cosθ
- True Power (P) = V I cosθ
> **Note:** The Arduino code calculating the Vrms, Irms, Power, and Energy calculations is attached.

# B.Energy Forecasting  

Implemented **Energy Consumption Forecasting** using Deep Learning (LSTM).  
This helps predict future energy usage trends, enabling smarter decisions and optimized billing.

## 🔹 Approach
- Used **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model in Python (TensorFlow/Keras).
- Input: historical energy data (1-sec intervals).
- Output: short-term & long-term energy usage forecasts.

## 🔹 Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing & lag feature generation (20 lags).
2. LSTM model definition & training (85% training, 15% testing).
3. Forecasting next 15 hours of energy usage.
4. Compared real vs predicted consumption.

## 🛠 Tools
- **Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy)** – Energy forecasting (LSTM).  
- **MySQL + PhpMyAdmin** – Simulated cloud platforms.  

## Deep Learning Algorithm Function for A Time Series Data
- Yₜ = f (Yt-1, Yt-2, …, Yt-p)
