# ioT-based Smart Energy Meter

IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter with Energy Forecasting

This repository contains the work for a University Module Team Project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
The main objective of this project was to design and simulate a system that can monitor real-time energy consumption, calculate electricity usage, and introduce smart billing while also predicting future consumption patterns using machine learning. 

This project aimed to demonstrate how energy wastage can be reduced, bills optimized, and usage trends analyzed for better decision-making.

# A. Simulation

## 🛠 Tools
- **Proteus 8 Professional** – Circuit design & simulation.  
- **Arduino IDE** – Code development & .hex file generation.  
- **MySQL + PhpMyAdmin** – Simulated cloud platforms.  

## Energy Calculation
- P (Watts) = V x I
- E (Jouls) = P x t 
- E (Watts per hour) = (P x t) / 3600
- θ = 50Hz x 360 x ∆t
- Power Factor = cosθ
- True Power (P) = V I cosθ
> **Note:** The Arduino code calculating the Vrms, Irms, Power, and Energy calculations is attached.

## ⚡ Challenges Faced  
- Limited sensor availability in Proteus → used alternatives.  
- ioT simulation challenges with ESP8266 → replaced with Ethernet controllers.  
- Debugging Arduino .hex file & baud rate errors.  
- Long training times for ML models with large datasets.
